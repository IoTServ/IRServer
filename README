This project allows you to send infrared remote-control commands to the Arduino via the virtual serial port, to be transmitted by an IR LED on pin3.

By default, commands are terminated by an LF (line-feed) and/or CR (carriage-return), but you can specify any other delimiter with a minor change.

I have only tested this project under Windows XP, with version 1.0.1 of the Arduino IDE, on an Arduino UNO R3.

An IR LED must be connected to Arduino PWM pin 3.  You will need the IRremote library from Ken Shirriff.  For details, see http://www.arcfn.com/2009/08/multi-protocol-infrared-remote-library.html.

The project consists of four files:
ArduinoServer.ino
IRServer.ino
IRServerApp.ino
README

ArduinoServer.ino:
This is a generic server sketch that contains the getCommand() and runCommand() methods; the server splash and help screens; and a list of custom commands to parse.  More info on the ArduinoServer project can be found at https://github.com/WilliamNorth/ArduinoServer.

IRServer.ino:
A sample Arduino sketch containing the setup() and loop() methods.  Configure the Serial Monitor to send a 'Newline' when the [Enter] key is pressed or the 'Send' button is clicked, and set the rate to 115200 baud.

IRServerApp.ino:
The IR-transmitter server application containing the IR command protocol parsers (custom methods called by the command-parser "ArduinoServer.ino").  Works only for the 20-bit SONY SIRC protocol right now.  More protocols and a front-end to be added soon.
